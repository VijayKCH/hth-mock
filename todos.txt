Done

1. wire up index page - renders a list of labs
2. wire up a lab page - render text for confirmation
3. wire up a toolbox page - render text for confirmation
    - add in a serach bar and button (not functional yet)
5. lab schema in models dir; integration of mongo + mongoose
6. createlab page to make a basic project
7. individual labs on index page redirect to lab page (url shows mongo _id
but not rendering data into the page yet) 
8. added the '&format=json' to end of route to allow me to see json as needed

To-Dos:
 - deploy to heroku so GC can look
1. Get title, text, and type to render onto lab page by mongo _id
2. Toolbox: hook up to mongoDB
3. Toolbox: search functionality of projects from toolbox
4. Toolbox: when you click on a tool, redirect to specific tool page

5. Add in theme
6. Pare down theme
7. Add in partials

8. add login/register 


GC:
I want them to see those 2 options, where the Toolbox allow immediate access
to the content, while the Labs link opens a sign up/ sign in page as you need
to be registered to create a lab.
