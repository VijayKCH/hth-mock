Done
1. wire up index page - render text for confirmation
2. wire up a labs page - render text for confirmation
3. wire up a toolbox page - render text for confirmation
4. add in a serach bar and button
5. partial integration of mongo + mongoose
To-Do:
1. attach the search to database...so its time to add in mongo
2. Set up mongoDB
2. add sign-in/register inputs on the labs page, and also on the nav bar.


GC:
I want them to see those 2 options, where the Toolbox allow immediate access to the content, while the Labs link opens a sign up/ sign in page as you need to be registered
--or the classic upper corner in the main pages

**no frames around the individual tools in the toolbox**
